[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/rtd-test-bed/badge/?version=latest)](http://rtd-test-bed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

This site has been established to isolate and test various issues with documentation build using the following components:

1. Doxygen
2. Sphinx
3. Breathe
4. Read the Docs

## Purpose

They Doxygen, Sphinx, Breathe and Read the Docs are all great tools. When put together, for some versions, sometimes, for some code they produce some errors or warnings. As there are four tools, in some cases it is difficult to find out where the problems is.

The purpose of this repository is to provide minimalistic code samples to test and present particular configuration that is causing issues.
